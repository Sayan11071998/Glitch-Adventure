# ***🚀 Glitch Adventure 🎮***

I’m excited (and mildly relieved!) to finally share GlitchAdventure—my latest Unreal Engine 5 creation! Imagine a world where tricky platforms, fierce enemies, and hidden coins come together for an epic adventure, and you’ve got GlitchAdventure. This game combines fast-paced platforming with combat and exploration, throwing you into levels where timing, strategy, and a bit of luck are key to survival.

### **🎮 In "GlitchAdventure," players will:**
- 🛤️ Master intricate platforms while avoiding the deadly sea water—because nothing says “game over” like an unexpected swim!
- ⚙️ Conquer moving platforms and obstacles that challenge both your timing and patience (I may have lost a few lives figuring them out).
- 💰 Hunt for coins scattered throughout each level—because, let’s be real, what's an adventure without treasure?
- 📦 Smash wooden boxes that may or may not have coins... you’ll just have to take a chance.
- 🔥 Battle enemies using fire bullets, carefully managing health and strategy (yes, that means dodge and shoot!).
- 🔑 Seek out the "Key" to unlock new levels and keep the adventure going!

This project wasn’t just about designing a game, but about pushing myself to integrate advanced mechanics like platforming challenges, AI-driven enemies, and level progression. GlitchAdventure was a great test of my skills in both Blueprints and C++, and I’m thrilled with how it turned out. Can’t wait to see what challenges lie ahead for me as I continue my journey into game development!
